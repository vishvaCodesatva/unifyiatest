        <p>Dummy. is a social AR enterprise. Our qwerty blockchain services provide play to earn and fun ways to
            express
            yourself.</p>
        <p>When you use these services, you share some information with us. Therefore, we want you to be open about what
            information we collect, how we use it,
            who we share it with, and what choices you have about controlling, accessing, and updating your information.
        </p>
        <p>If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, simply email us at support@Dummy.io</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>There are three basic categories of information we collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Information you give us voluntarily.</li>
            <li>Information we receive when you use our services.</li>
            <li>Information we receive from third parties.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> Information you give us voluntarily</h4>
        <p>When you interact with our Services, we collect the information you choose to provide to us. For example,
            most of
            our services require you to create a game account. To do this, we need some important information from you,
            such
            as a unique username you want to use, a password, an email address, a phone number, and your date of birth.
            To
            make it easier for others to find you, we may also ask you for some additional information that will be
            publicly
            visible on our Services, such as profile pictures, a name, or other useful identifying information. Other
            services, such as merchant products, may also require you to provide us with a debit or credit card number
            and
            associated account information. Of course, you’ll also provide us whatever information you send through the
            services, such as photos or other media. Keep in mind that the users you send any content to can always save
            that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense that applies to the Internet at large
            applies
            to the game as well: don’t send messages or share content that you wouldn’t want someone to save or share.
        </p>

        <p>When you contact customer support or communicate with us in any other way, we’ll collect whatever information
            you
            volunteer.</p>
        <h4> Information we receive when you use our services</h4>
        <p>When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you used and how you used
            them.
            For example, we know that you have viewed an AR item, watched a video, seen a particular ad over a period of
            time, and sent an AR item to friends. Here is a more detailed explanation of the types of information we
            collect
            when you use our Services:</p>
        <p>Usage Information. We collect information about your activities on our Services. For example, we may collect
            information about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>how you interact with the Services, such as what AR object you view or apply to Dummy, or what
                search
                queries you make.</li>
            <li> how you communicate with other Dummy users, such as their names, the time and date of your
                communications, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange
                messages
                with the most, and your interactions with messages (for example, when you open a message or take a
                screenshot).</li>
            <li> Content Information. We collect content you create on our Services, such as custom AR worlds, and
                information about the content you create or provide, such as whether the recipient viewed the content
                and
                the metadata provided with the content.</li>
            <li> Device Information. We collect information from and about the devices you use. For example, we collect:
            </li>
            <li> Information about your hardware and software, such as hardware model, operating system version, device
                memory, advertising identifiers, unique application identifiers, installed apps, unique device
                identifiers,
                browser type, language, battery level, and time zone;</li>
            <li> information from device sensors, such as accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, microphone; and o
                information
                about your wireless and mobile network connections, such as mobile phone number, service provider, and
                signal strength.</li>
            <li> Device Phonebook. Because Dummy is about communicating with friends, we may - with your consent -
                collect information from your device's phone book.</li>
            <li> Camera, Photos and Videos. Many of our Services require us to collect images and other information from
                your device's camera, photos and videos. For example, you will not be able to send Dummy or upload
                photos and
                videos from your camera roll if we cannot access your camera, photos and videos. </li>
            <li> Location Information. When you use our Services, we may collect information about your location. With
                your
                consent, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods such as GPS, wireless
                networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points and other sensors such as gyroscopes, accelerometers and
                compasses. </li>

        </ul>

        <h5>Information We Collect from Third Parties</h5>
        <p>We may collect information that other users provide about you when they use our services. For example, if
            another
            user allows us to collect information from their phone book and you are one of their contacts, we may
            combine
            the information from that user's phone book with other information we have collected about you.</p>
        <h4>How We Use Information</h4>
        <p>What do we do with the information we collect? The short answer is: Provide you with a set of products and
            services that we constantly improve. Here are some of the ways we do that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> develop, operate, improve, deliver, maintain, and protect our products and services.</li>
            <li> send you communications, ltdluding by email. For example, we may use email to respond to support
                inquiries
                or to share information about our products, services, and promotional offers that we think may interest
                you.
                monitor and analyse trends and usage.
            </li>
            <li> personalize the services by, among other things, suggesting friends or profile information, or
                customizing
                the content we show you, ltdluding ads.</li>
            <li> contextualize your experience by, among other things, tagging your Memories content using your precise
                location data (if, of course, you’ve consented to us collecting that data) and applying other labels
                based
                on the content.</li>
            <li>provide and improve ad targeting and measurement, ltdluding through the use of your precise location
                data
                (again, if you’ve consented to us collecting that data), both on and off our services. See the Control
                Over
                Your Information section below for more information about Dummy Ltd.’s promotion practices and your
                choices.</li>
            <li> enhance the safety and security of our products and services.</li>
            <li>verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity.</li>

            <li> enforce our Terms of Service and other usage policies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We may also store some information locally on your device. For example, we may store information as local
            cache
            so that you can open the app and view content faster.</p>
        <h4>How We Share Information</h4>

        <ul>

                Services. </li>
            <li>Any additional information you have consented to share.</li>
